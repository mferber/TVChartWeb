# TVChartWeb

A silly project, based on an [equally silly project](https://github.com/mferber/TVChart), to keep track of the TV we're watching. The original version generated a PDF to be filled in, but periodically reprinting the PDF was a pain. This project reimplements it as a webapp that can be accessed from all our devices and doesn't need to be printed out ever.
